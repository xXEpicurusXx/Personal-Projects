After creating the API for testing, I coded out a function that deletes the image both from inside Django
and from inside the media file inside the directory. If a user wants to upload a new image to that table, 
the old image will be replaced by the new image in that media folder. 

Question:
If a user wants to add a new image to that field, do we want to replace the old one with the new one or 
<<<<<<< HEAD
only delete that image if the user selects the clear box?

    def save(self,force_insert=False, force_update=False, using=None,*args, **kwargs):

        if self.id:
            
            self.image_file = image_utils.compress_image_if_over_1mb(self.image_file)

            existing = get_object_or_404(InitiativeCategory, id = self.id)
            if existing.image_file != self.image_file:
                existing.image_file.delete(save=False)

        super(InitiativeCategory, self).save(*args, **kwargs)



bug in custom initiative, send update to borort and heip
updated Class Business in models.py; if the image is not meant to be deleted then delete line 227 - 229
=======
only delete that image if the user selects the clear box?
